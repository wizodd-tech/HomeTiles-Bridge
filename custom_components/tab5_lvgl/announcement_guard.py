"""Checks for panel announcements on tab5_lvgl/config/{id}/bridge.

Anyone on the MQTT broker can publish there. These pure helpers keep such
messages from binding, changing or flooding config entries:

* the topic id must be the announced device id, in the firmware's format;
* a paired panel (command_channel.py) signs its announcement, and the Bridge
  accepts an announcement for a paired entry only with a valid signature;
* new-panel discovery cards are limited in number and rate.

Signature: the panel appends ``,"sig":"<64 hex>"`` before the final ``}``,
where sig = HMAC-SHA256(announce key, topic + "\\n" + unsigned payload) and the
unsigned payload is the exact JSON text without that member. The announce
key is HKDF-SHA256 of the pairing key with the info label "announce". See
docs-dev/command-encryption.md in the HomeTiles firmware repository.
